So what happened back [there]? That was pretty weird, right?
Yeah, I’ve never been to a rager that [intense] before. Did you see what happened to Petey? Poor guy.
Yeah, I feel really [bad] about that. That almost happened to me before, but everyone was really nice about it.
That’s [good]. Nobody deserves that. Can’t say he had it coming though.
What does it [mean] to deserve something? That has always confused me.
I mean like - like you know what he did to Kayla. He ruined her [dress]. Those tomato stains will never come out! It totally was karma for him.
You [sure] it was tomato stains?
Ehh, tomato, not [tomahto].
